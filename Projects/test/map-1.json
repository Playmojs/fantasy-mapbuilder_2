{"marker_ids":[],"map_info":{"content":"# Magil\n It is well known that large demon cities are rare - something about demons and orderly society simply doesn’t blend well. In many ways it’s a wonder they exist at all, because you will be hard pressed to find any people less submissive to rules than the demons, famed for their pursuit of personal power and might. \n In that light, it is downright absurd to enter Magil, a city in the middle of barren plains, some distance from the closest magma river, Kvarith, or any portal, and that seems to attract demons from across the realm because of its rules. \n To understand this, one must understand demons, and one must understand these rules. They are no regular rules: they are the rules of Valduur. \n Demons wouldn’t typically follow rules because some random dude made them up and put his name to them. Valduur is not just anyone in demon history - he is remembered as the strongest, and his name is said in praise more often than any other. There is not a demon who doesn’t know who he was, or have heard the stories of his adventures and dominance. However, even so, his rules aren’t by themselves strong enough to topple demon stubbornness. \n What Valduur did, when he made his rules, was capture something of the demon essence within them. Few understood demons as well as Valduur did, and the rules he made were so fundamental that any demon who hears them feels something deep in the root of their hearts, a sense of belonging, and purpose. The rules encourage the path to strength, they promote the sense that the strongest should rule, they underline the importance of community and caring about those dear to you. \n During Valduur’s time, Magil expanded as a city, united under his image of the good path. However, in his wake, multiple factions began to disagree about what true strength is. Some emphasized physical strength, some spoke of combat, others magic, and others yet again mental strength. Quickly, it became clear that thirteen such schools of thought existed, and these have been established since as the thirteen schools of Magil. \n Each school claims to be the true descendant of Valduur’s teaching, and each claims that all the other schools are forgeries or have misunderstood the good message. Each has their own cultures and typically control their own part of Magil. Practically all demons in Magil belong to one of these schools, and so which school one belongs to says something of one’s personality and goal in life. \n \n In Magul, about 80 % of the area belongs to the different schools, in different capacities. Of the remaining 20 %, about half is the central palace, where the city rulers sit and all schools visit to pay homage to the shrine of Valduur. The remaining half is neutral area, the largest roads, the markets etc. \n I will describe the different schools and their areas later, but in this section I will simply outline the neutral area and the palace. \n To understand the palace, one must understand the Sun Ceremony. This is an annual ceremony, and determines much of the social structure in Magil both in and out of the different schools. Each school sends all their strongest warriors into a competition, in which the winners not only get praise and rewards from their schools, but also get positions of power within the city. It is important to recognize that this gives the strongest and largest schools large benefits for the control of the city at large. However, dominating schools are held in check by two forces: \n One, the rules of Valduur outline proper conduct, even in scenarios where one part is vastly stronger than the other. Normally, demons would say that the stronger party could do whatever he wants to the weaker, but in Magil this would be frowned upon. \n Second, there is an internal respect between all the schools, because they all dedicate themselves to the search for strength. Of course, they would never show this respect in public, or directly in conversation, but it underlies all of Magil and the interactions between schools, and all school elders are aware of this intimately. \n \n The neutral areas are places where merchants, foreigners and visitors reside, unless they have an agreement with either the temple or one of the many schools. It is also where most open markets are located. There are five main roads entering Magil, from five large gates in the surrounding wall, and the neutral areas wrap these five roads. Going too far from some road will inevitably lead to entering school territory, and, by extension, danger. \n Outside the Magil walls are large residential areas - the grip of the schools is weaker here, so there are people here that have no connection to schools, and poverty is common. No homeless are allowed to sleep in neutral area within the walls.\n"},"image":"/magil.png","parent_id":0}
